The 3-dimensionality of this graph makes it difficult to interpret, depth and height are difficult to visually resolve. The color seems to change across the plot and I'm not exactly sure why or what it means. I am not exactly sure what question is being answered, but I would draw the plot on 2 dimensions and indicate the 3rd dimension (depending on which features are most relevant) by the size the point or the color/intensity of the point.
