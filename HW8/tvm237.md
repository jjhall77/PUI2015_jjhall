The third dimension does a disservice to this graph. I cannot resolve depth and height from it to understand the magnitude of incomes differences across sex and race. Visually, one can't tell which race goes with which line without referring to the legend. The legend makes the y axis redundant, so I would remove it and display this information in the 2-D plane. I see a lot of downward slopes but I don't see how it varies across race, which may be the interesting question that could be clearly seen in 2-D. These data could be shown with a clustered bar graph or a horizontal dot plot.
