Aside from a minor typo in the ylabel, this is a very nice looking graph. The color choices for the top cities bring to bear the purpose of the graph. The alpha level is appropriate. I'm confused a little by the x-scale- it looks like it's normalizedbut I see a 1e7 label in the lower right corner of the graph. Aside from those minor fixes, it's well done.
